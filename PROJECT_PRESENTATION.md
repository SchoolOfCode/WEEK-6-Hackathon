Markdown allows you to easily format text by using symbols like # for headers, * or _ for emphasis, and - for lists. It helps you create headings, lists, links, images, and more in a simple and readable way.


When using a tool like readme.so, you can input details about your project such as its description, installation instructions, usage examples, and even embed images or videos. The tool then generates the Markdown code for your README file, saving you time and ensuring consistency in your project documentation.

Put your plan, story, and any supporting material here, you could use the help of a readme markdown generator such as [readme.so](https://readme.so/)
