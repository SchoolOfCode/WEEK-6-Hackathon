PLAN DESCRIPTION

## IDEAS & PLANNING

1. My Idea was to create simple mathematic quiz, that would require from the user to complete few calculations before getting the final result. 
2. I considered two options: descriptive challenge, where user received the story behind the quiz or just simple calculation function. I decided to go with the first option (descriptive quiz). 
3. While preparing plan I created 2 MVPs for my project.

## MVP1 

1. To create Kata about winner of the local raffle who shared his prize between 4 nephews. User would know only the amount given to the 4 nephews and following few steps would calculate the full raffle prize. 
2. To properly set the VScode files including: npm installation, adding vitest to the devDependencies, adding export to the main.js file and import to the main.test.js. 
3. Following the Test Driven Development, to create the test based on the Kata result and run the failing test. 
4. To write the function matching the test results to make sure the Kata works properly.
5. To add more tests defining if the function works correctly. 

## MVP2

1. To add one more challenge to the quiz, where the amount of first nephew wouldn't be less than 100 and no more than 1000 also divisible by 100.  
2. To create the test that checks if point 1 of MVP2 is met. 

## KATA DESCRIPTION:

"Mr. Brown was very lucky and won a local raffle prize. He decided to share all the amount between his 4 nephews. Your task is to write a function named 'totalPrize' which takes a number describing the amount that was given to the first nephew and to return the 'totalPrize'. To complete this challenge, please consider the following:

1. The amount given to the first nephew was not less than 100 and no more than 1000 and divisible by 100.
2. Second nephew received 50% less than the first nephew.
3. The third nephew received 3 times more money than the second nephew.
4. The fourth nephew received 5 times less than the money received by the 3 other nephews together.
5. Knowing how much money nephews received, please return the amount of the total prize.
6. If first nephew's amount is under 100 or above 1000 please return "Invalid input"


## KATA FUNCTION: 
1.      function totalPrize(firstNephew){
2.              // Good Luck!
3.      return totalPrize 
4       return "Invalid input"
5.      }

## REFLECTIONS: 
1. This hackaton nicely consoldated the knowledge from this week. 
2. Deffinitely different approched was needed for a single project. 
3. Sharing details within our group helped to improved our projects alot.  
4. In my project it was very helpful to create 2 MVPs as MVP2 took some time to solve but at least I had MVP1 ready in place. 
5. For the first time I fully followed the TDD method and was able to see the beenefits of this method.
