PLAN DESCRIPTION

## IDEAS & PLANNING

1. My concept was to develop a straightforward math quiz that required users to perform a few calculations before obtaining the final answer.
2. I contemplated two alternatives: a descriptive challenge where the user would learn the story behind the quiz or a straightforward calculation function. I opted for the descriptive quiz.
3. During the planning phase, I developed two MVPs for my project.

## MVP1 

1. To develop a Kata about the local raffle winner who divided his prize among four nephews. The user would only know the amount given to each nephew, and a series of steps would calculate the total raffle prize.
2. To correctly configure the VScode files, including npm installation, adding vitest to the devDependencies, exporting from the main.js file, and importing into the main.test.js file.
3. Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, to create a test based on the Kata outcome and run the failing test.
4. To write a function that matches the test results to ensure the Kata functions correctly.
5. To add additional tests to verify the function's correctness.

## MVP2

1. To enhance the quiz by adding an additional challenge where the amount of the first nephew must not be less than 100, not more than 1000, and must be divisible by 100.
2. To develop a test that verifies if the first requirement of MVP2 is fulfilled.

## KATA DESCRIPTION:

"Mr. Brown was very lucky and won a local raffle prize. He decided to share all the amount between his 4 nephews. Your task is to write a function named 'totalPrize' which takes a number describing the amount that was given to the first nephew and to return the 'totalPrize'. To complete this challenge, please consider the following:

1. The amount given to the first nephew was not less than 100 and no more than 1000 and divisible by 100.
2. Second nephew received 50% less than the first nephew.
3. The third nephew received 3 times more money than the second nephew.
4. The fourth nephew received 5 times less than the money received by the 3 other nephews together.
5. Knowing how much money nephews received, please return the amount of the total prize.
6. If first nephew's amount is under 100 or above 1000 please return "Invalid input"


## KATA FUNCTION: 
1.      function totalPrize(firstNephew){
2.              // Good Luck!
3.      return totalPrize 
4       return "Invalid input"
5.      }

## REFLECTIONS: 
1. The hackathon effectively consolidated the knowledge gained this week.
2. A distinct approach was definitely required for a single project.
3. Sharing details within our group significantly improved our projects.
4. In my project, creating two MVPs was very helpful. MVP2 took some time to solve, but having MVP1 ready was beneficial.
5. For the first time, I fully adhered to the TDD method and was able to experience its benefits.
